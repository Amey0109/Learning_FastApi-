We Make Virtual ENV to isolate python environment with the Python Virtual Environment
if we run pip list directly outside virtual env we see list of python libraries installed in our pc/laptop but when we create Virtual ENV and then run pip list then it will only show pip library, the other libraries has not installed in that ENV. 
So you can installed that libraries by executing pip install <lib name> in ENV

In Command Line:
Go to directory folder where you want to create Virtual ENV
python -m venv <ENV_NAME>

To activate Virtual ENV
<ENV_NAME>\Scripts\activate.bat

pip list  - To show the installed libraries in that ENV 

To deactivate Virtual ENV
deactivate
